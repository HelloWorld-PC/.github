HelloWorld PC is a software house established in Athens, Greece back in 2018 by [Mr. Marios Fakiolas](mailto:marios@helloworld.gr).

We are a remote-first company and our headquarters are located in [Halandri, Athens](https://goo.gl/maps/tHQF4thDHu4Nndt99).

Our mission is to solve real life problems and provide appealing and smart solutions by taking advantage of modern
technologies.

As of March 2023, HelloWorld is a team of 16 people who provide professional services in the area of web and mobile
applications.

We do UX, Frontend Development (React, React Native & VueJS), Backend Development (Python & PHP), and AWS cloud
DevOps. That said, we provide services in the full spectrum from designing to developing and eventually launching
an application.

Our collaborations are project-based, and we work by following the [Agile Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)
methodology while having weekly or biweekly milestones so that our engineers work closely with the customers'
stakeholders all way long.

Apart from client-work, we have been developing some promising and ambitious products by offering modern solutions
to the end-user.
